## Domain Modeling

Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model of code for a specific problem.

## HTML Table Basics

HTML tables were intended to be used for presenting data, not for layout. 
Tables are made up of various elements, such as:
- tr (table row)
- th (table head)
- td (table data)

## Constructors

A constructor is just a function called using the a keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:
- create a new object
- bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
- run the code in the constructor
- return the new object.

Using this in a constructor refers to the constructor itself. Using this in an object literal refers to the object.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. 
JavaScript prototypes are used to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor.

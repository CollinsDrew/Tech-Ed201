## ***HTML fundamentals***

Semantic HTML uses elements for the particular purpose that is needed. This makes it easier for both humans and machines to read and understand.
There are 6 **heading** levels in HTML. H1 through to H6. H1 being the highest or most important, H6 being the smallest or least important.
The <abbr> represents an abbriviation or acronym. When using <abbr>, you must provide the full term of the abbriviation to inform the user what the 
abbriviation or acronym means.
  
## ***Structured CSS***
  
  
There are three ways to add CSS to HTML.
- Add inline CSS in a style attribute to style a single HTML element on the page
- You can embed an internal stylesheet by adding CSS to the head section of your HTML doc.
- You can link to an external stylesheet that will contain all your CSS separate from your HTML.

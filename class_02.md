## ***HTML fundamentals***

Semantic HTML uses elements for the particular purpose that is needed. This makes it easier for both humans and machines to read and understand.
There are 6 **heading** levels in HTML. H1 through to H6. H1 being the highest or most important, H6 being the smallest or least important.
The <abbr> represents an abbriviation or acronym. When using <abbr>, you must provide the full term of the abbriviation to inform the user what the 
abbriviation or acronym means.
  
## ***Structured CSS***
  
  
There are three ways to add CSS to HTML.
- Add inline CSS in a style attribute to style a single HTML element on the page.
- You can embed an internal stylesheet by adding CSS to the head section of your HTML doc.
- You can link to an external stylesheet that will contain all your CSS separate from your HTML.  

Inline styles should be avoided because they generally are not the best way to maintain your website.
It goes against every one of the best practices when structuring your code, and inline styles don't separate content from design.
  
## ***Javascript basics***
  
There are quite a few JS operators. Such as:
  
  | Operator | Description|
  | -------- | ---------- |
  | + | Addition |
  | - | Subtraction |
  | * | Multiplication |
  | ** | Exponentiation |
  | / | Division |
  | % | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
  | ++ | Increment |
  | -- | Decrement |

When you create a function, it can contain any amount of code and any type of code. You can create variables, change variables, perform logical comparisons with conditionals and any number of other tasks all contained within a single function.
The flexibility that functions provide our code means that we need to keep track of where data is being passed. For example, if I were to create a function for counting up on a certain variable, then my function wouldnâ€™t need to pass any data at all. My function would just count up on that variable. But if I wanted to create a more flexible function that would add one to any number or to any variable, then I would need a way to tell that function which variable to manipulate. This way I can choose what variable needs to be changed by choosing what is passed into the function.

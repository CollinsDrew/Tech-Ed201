# Class 3

## Lab 03

In the lab for class 3, we had to carry on working on out **About me** page. 
We had previously added 5 question to the page in ***lab 02***, that required yes or no answers. In ***lab 03***, we added a sixth question.
In this question, we had to ask the user for an interger. We created a button that used **prompt** functionsto tell the user if they were too high or too low on their guess. For this we use **'IF'**, **'ELSE IF'** and **'ELSE'** conditions. 
We then had to make it so that the user had just 4 attempts to guess the number. For this, we created a **for loop**.

## HTML lists

An unordered list (<ul>) is used to create a list of related items, in no particular order. 
An unordered list typically is a bulleted list of items.
The opening list tag must be <UL> and then by the first list item (<LI>).
You can change the bullet style of an unordered list by using 'list-style-type'. The options available are:
  - circle
  - square
  -upper-roman
  -lower-alpha

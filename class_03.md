# Class 3

## Lab 03

In the lab for class 3, we had to carry on working on out **About me** page. 
We had previously added 5 question to the page in ***lab 02***, that required yes or no answers. In ***lab 03***, we added a sixth question.
In this question, we had to ask the user for an interger. We created a button that used **prompt** functionsto tell the user if they were too high or too low on their guess. For this we use **'IF'**, **'ELSE IF'** and **'ELSE'** conditions. 
We then had to make it so that the user had just 4 attempts to guess the number. For this, we created a **for loop**.

## HTML lists

### Unordered lists

An unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in no particular order. 
An unordered list typically is a bulleted list of items.
The opening list tag must be UL and then by the first list item LI.
You can change the bullet style of an unordered list by using 'list-style-type'. The options available are:
  - circle
  - square
  - upper-roman
  - lower-alpha

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists are used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.
An ordered list created using the OL element, and each list item starts with the LI element. 
An ordered list should used when the related items **have** to be in that particular sequence.
Like unordered list, you can also use the CSS list-style-type property to change the numbering type in an ordered list.
  1. circle
  2. square
  3. upper-roman
  4. lower-alpha

## CSS box model

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
  - Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
  - Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
  - Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
  - Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

## Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

### Arrays

Arrays are basically lists that contain multiple values. In an array we can store various data types:
  - Strings
  - intergers (numbers)
  - objects
  - even other arrays

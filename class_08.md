## CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is made for one dimensional layouts, this means that you are laying out items in one direction, allowing you to arrange elements around each other
and not on top of or stacked on each other.
Flexbox operates in a 2 axes system: a main and a cross axis. The main axis is your defining direction of how your flex items are placed in the flex container.
Determining the cross axis is very simple, it's in the direction that's perpendicular to your main axis.
Flexbox can negatively impact accessibility because it alters the layout and screen readers find it difficult to read in a non-linear manner.

## Flexbox layout

Instead of using a float to create layouts by floating elements to the left or the right, flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis.
The axis can be horizontal or vertical. It is best used for distributing space for items in the same axis.

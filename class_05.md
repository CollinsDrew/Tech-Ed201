## HTML Media

Alt text, or alternative text, is primarily used by people who use screen readers to access websites, apps, and other software.
Its a snippet of detailed information describing what an image shows.
However, aside from that vital function, alt text is crucial in enabling your website images to be accurately appreciated and acknowledged by
search engines.
This improves accessibility.
The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
GIF, just like other image formats, are not resolution-independent, and will therefore look pixelated when scaled up or viewed on higher resolutions.
GIF also supports animation.
SVG is scalable and resolution-independent, and will look crisp clear on any screen resolution.
If you wanted to display a screenshot on your website, a JPEG would be best as it provides high clarity images.

The **color** property defines the foreground color of an HTML element's content and the **background-color** property defines the element's background color.
These can be used on just about any element.
You could use colors in things in certain sections of your website, such as headers, card backgrounds and on lists etc, to give it abit more life, and seperate
certain sections of the website from others.

  
When choosing a font for websites, you should consider:
- Branding. What suits the clients needs the most.
- Clarity. Make sure its easy to read.
- Style. What suits the mood of the content
  
The **font-weight** property sets how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed.
The **font-size** property sets the size of a font.
The **font-style** property specifies the font style for a text.

You can add spacing around the characters in a h1 element by using either letter-spacing or font-kerning.

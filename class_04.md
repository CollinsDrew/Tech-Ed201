## Hyperlinks

To create **hyperlinks** we use the anchor element and wrap our text in <a><a/>.
The href='' attribute is used to add the link itself to the text.
It’s most important for link text to make sense without the surrounding sentences or content. The link text alone should convey the function and purpose of the link. Link text should also be unique and easy to speak out loud.

## CSS layout
  
Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.
The normal flow refers to the arrangement of elements whose position is controlled by the 'relative' value of the 'position' property.
  
### Block-level & Inline elements
  
A block-level element is an HTML element that begins a new line on a web page and extends the full width of the available horizontal space of its parent element. Most HTML elements are block-level elements.

In contrast to a block-level element, an inline element:
- It can begin within a line.
- It does not start a new line.
- Its width only extends as far as it is defined by its tags. 

**Static** is the default positioning for every HTML element.
  
The advantage of **absolute** positioning is that you can easily position your div anywhere you want with "bottom:";, "top:";, "right:"; and "left:".
A **fixed** position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself, where as **absolute** is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element.
  
## Learn JS
  
A function declaration tells the JavaScript engine about a function's name, return type, and parameters. When a function has been declared, it can be used anytime inside a class or development scope whenever it's been called/invoked.
  
Function Invocation is used to executes the function code and it is common to use the term “call a function” instead of “invoke a function”. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.
  
Parameters are properties of a function. Arguments are properties of a particular call to a function. In javascript, if you don't give a number of arguments equal to the number of parameters, the extra come across as undefined .

## HTML Forms

Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data from users,
or allowing them to control a user interface.
Forms allow us to take and validate all kinds of data.
When designing a form, for the best possible user experience, you should:
- Keep it short. Only ask what is required
- Make is simple. No need to complicate the form and confuse the user
- Place labels above the corresponding input felds
- Minimize the number of input fields and user typing effort

Form elements include:
- <form> the container element for the form as a whole
- <input> used to capture and take the data
- <label> defines a label for an **input** element
- <button> is used for submitting or progressing forms

## HTML Forms

Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data from users,
or allowing them to control a user interface.
Forms allow us to take and validate all kinds of data.
When designing a form, for the best possible user experience, you should:
- Keep it short. Only ask what is required
- Make is simple. No need to complicate the form and confuse the user
- Place labels above the corresponding input felds
- Minimize the number of input fields and user typing effort

Form elements include:
- ***form*** the container element for the form as a whole
- ***input*** used to capture and take the data
- ***label*** defines a label for an **input** element
- ***button*** is used for submitting or progressing forms
- ***multiple*** allows the user to select more than one value

## Learn JS

JS events are essebtially just interactions from the user with the webpage. The change in the state of an object is known as an Event.
The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for (type of event), and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets executed.
The target property of the event object is always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.
This property gives us access to the properties of that element.
Event capturing is the event starts from top element to the target element. It is the opposite of Event bubbling, which starts from target element to the top element.
